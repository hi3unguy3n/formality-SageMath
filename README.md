# Degree of formality of nilpotent Lie algebras

Written in SageMath, this function does the following:
1) Take a nilpotent Lie algebra as an input
2) Calculate its dual commutative differential graded algebra
3) Calculate the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology
4) Return the degree of formality.

The PDF contains an overview of the basic fundamentals for this method. It also includes a proof for the upper bound of the degree. All comments and suggestions are welcome :)
